# Citi Bike Data Analysis Project

## Overview

Congratulations on your new role as the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program! This project involves building a set of data reports and dashboards to provide insights into the Citi Bike program's utilization, helping city officials to publicize and improve the program.

## Project Description

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has collected and organized monthly bike data, making it public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. Despite the regular updates, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. Your task is to aggregate the data from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, discover two unexpected phenomena, and create visualizations to provide answers to city officials' questions.

## Prerequisites

- [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)
- Citi Bike Data (CSV files from the Citi Bike Data webpage)
- Basic understanding of Tableau for creating visualizations and dashboards

## Data Selection

- Download 1-3 recent zip files from the Citi Bike Data source.
- Ensure the data uses the same columns across multiple files to avoid inconsistencies.
- Limit the data file size to 1GB for performance considerations in Tableau.

## Analysis Questions

The following are suggested questions to guide your analysis:

1. How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
2. By what percentage has total ridership grown?
3. How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
4. What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
5. What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?
6. What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Why are these top locations?
7. What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Why are these top locations?
8. What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Why are these bottom locations?
9. What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Why are these bottom locations?
10. How does the average trip duration change by the type of user?
11. What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?
12. Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection?
13. How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

## Visualizations

Create 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4-10 total). The visualizations should be insightful, focused, and visually appealing. Suggested visualizations include:

1. Total Trips Over Time (Line Chart)
2. User Type Distribution (Bar Chart)
3. Peak Hours Analysis (Heat Map)
4. Top 10 Stations for Starting Trips (Bar Chart)
5. Top 10 Stations for Ending Trips (Bar Chart)
6. Trip Duration by User Type (Box Plot)
7. Distance Analysis (Histogram)

## Dashboards and Maps

1. **Basic Map:** A static map plotting all bike stations with indications of popular start and end locations, with zip code data overlaid.
2. **Advanced Map:** A dynamic map showing changes in station popularity over time, with zip code data overlaid.

## Final Presentation

Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards. Ensure the presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.

## Steps to Save and Share Your Work

1. **Save to Tableau Public:**
   - Open Tableau Public Desktop.
   - Connect to your data source.
   - Create visualizations and dashboards.
   - Click `File` > `Save to Tableau Public As...`.
   - Log in to Tableau Public, enter a name for your workbook, and save.
   - Copy the URL from the web browser to share your workbook.

2. **Optional: Save as .twbx File:**
   - Click `File` > `Export As...` > `Packaged Workbook`.
   - Upload the .twbx file to your GitHub repository.

## Considerations

- Ensure data consistency and cleanliness.
- Create visualizations with small extracts before importing large datasets.
- Avoid overwhelming data; focus on recent and relevant data.
- Use calculated fields to derive necessary metrics.
- Pay attention to labels, color schemes, and visual storytelling.
- Accompany visualizations with clear and directed analysis.

## Assessment Criteria

Your final product will be assessed on:

- Analytic Rigor
- Readability
- Visual Appeal

## Hints and Tips

- Get creative with combining CSV files.
- Ensure data is consistent and clean.
- Build visualizations with small data extracts.
- Use calculated fields for metrics.
- Pay attention to labels and formatting.
- Provide thoughtful analysis and insights.
